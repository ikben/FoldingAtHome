## Deploying on ECS/Fargate Using CDK

We've included CDK fiels to help you deploy on AWS in fargate, check out [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html) to get setup.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

Once installed run:

```
cd cdk
npm install
npm run build
cdk deploy
```

### Useful commands

 * `npm install -g aws-cdk`	install the aws cdk
 * `npm install`     install all required modules
 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region

### Manually switching to SPOT (save some money)

Get your account id:

```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

Using the aws CLI and changing the ARN / region:

```
aws ecs put-cluster-capacity-providers --cluster arn:aws:ecs:eu-west-1:YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:cluster/CdkfoldingStack-FoldingClusterYOUR_CLUSTER_UID --capacity-providers FARGATE FARGATE_SPOT --default-capacity-provider-strategy capacityProvider=FARGATE_SPOT,weight=100 --region eu-west-1
```

## Running on Kubernetes

To run on kubernetes in AWS, GCP, Azure and other simply run the following:

```
cd k8s
kubectl create namespace dev
kubectl apply -f foldingathome-deployment.yaml
```
